                <span>In Mastermind, one player (the codemaker) selects a secret code consisting of a
                    sequence of four colored
                    pegs, chosen from six possible colors. The other player (the codebreaker) has to guess the code
                    within a
                    set number of attempts.

                    After each guess, the codemaker provides feedback using smaller pegs:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A black peg indicates a correct color in the correct position.</li>
                        <li>A white peg indicates a correct color in the wrong position.</li>
                        <li>No peg means the guessed color is not in the code.</li>
                    </ul>
                    The codebreaker uses the feedback to refine their guesses until they either crack the code or run
                    out of
                    attempts.

                <span>Mastermind is a code-breaking game created by Israeli postmaster Mordecai Meirowitz in 1970,
                    inspired
                    by the older game "Bulls and Cows." After struggling to find a publisher, Meirowitz partnered with
                    British company Invicta Plastics, which began producing the game in 1971 using colored pegs and a
                    plastic board. It quickly became a global hit for its combination of simple rules and deep strategy,
                    selling millions of copies. Mastermind's popularity was boosted by its iconic advertising, featuring
                    a mysterious model and the company's chairman. The game has since spawned many variations but
                    remains a classic in puzzle gaming.</span>
