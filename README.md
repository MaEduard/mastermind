A two-player version of the mastermind game implemented with websockets, Node.js, Express, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

This project was created for the course Web science & Database Technology (CSE1500). 

There is definitely room for improvements and if if you'd like to contribute and help me, itâ€™s best to submit an issue on this specific repository. Many thanks in advance.
