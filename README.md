# Mastermind webgame

A two-player version of the mastermind game implemented with websockets, Node.js, Express, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

This project was created for the course Web science & Database Technology (CSE1500). 

There is definitely room for improvements and if if you'd like to contribute and help me, it’s best to submit an issue on this specific repository. Many thanks in advance.
